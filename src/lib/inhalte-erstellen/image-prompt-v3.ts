  reportage: "Candid snapshot photography: a spontaneous 35mm point-and-shoot flash photograph, taken from inside the moment rather than arranged for an advertisement. Direct on-camera flash is the dominant light on nearby subjects, including in daylight: small hard shadows behind objects, bright near-field highlights, rapid falloff and a darker ambient background. Crisp flash-frozen motion, blunt frontal illumination and natural unretouched skin. Handheld, slightly tilted and off-centre framing, with an imperfect crop and incidental foreground overlap when the existing customer scene allows it. When human subjects are requested, catch them mid-action, mid-laugh or mid-sentence rather than posed for the camera; partial figures may fall outside the frame. The product belongs naturally to the customer action, not an isolated hero product or a styled table arrangement. Restrained film-snapshot color, believable flash highlights and ambient shadows; no polished editorial color grade, beauty lighting or cinematic rim light unless the customer explicitly asks for them. Use the generous depth of field of a compact-camera snapshot. For environmental or full-body framing, use a moderately wide lens and sufficient depth of field to resolve the subjects and the ground around their feet together; do not apply portrait-mode background blur to nearby ground. If grass is already present, resolve irregular individual blades and tufts, uneven growth, subtle green and dry tones, small gaps and contact shadows at the visible scale. If gravel or stone is already present, resolve separate irregular stones, plausible edges, sizes, gaps and contact shadows, with detail decreasing naturally into the distance. Ground texture must remain coherent across the focal plane, without localized soft patches, melted grass, smeared gravel, repeated texture stamps or waxy denoising. Allow gradual optical softness only with real focus distance; preserve natural texture without crunchy sharpening or making every distant surface equally sharp. These rules describe existing surfaces only and must not add grass, gravel or scenery to the customer scene. Keep readable product artwork and coherent material detail, without turning the moment into studio photography. Snapshot character comes from flash, timing, framing and color, not low resolution, smeared textures or artificial blur. Do not add subjects, props or actions merely to demonstrate this treatment.",
  premium: "Natural, high-quality editorial photography with the texture and optical character of a real full-frame camera. Choose one lens and aperture suited to the customer composition: an 85mm prime around f/2–f/2.8 for a close subject, a 50mm prime around f/2.8 for a medium view, or a 35mm lens around f/4 for an environmental view. Stop down to f/4–f/5.6 when the important subjects occupy different depths. Treat the image as one credible photographic exposure from one camera position, with consistent perspective, scale, focus and light throughout. Choose depth of field from the composition rather than automatically maximizing background blur: use a crisp main focal plane, smooth progressive focus falloff and optical bokeh only where lens, aperture and subject distance support it. In wider views, keep enough depth to resolve the important subjects and their immediate surroundings together. Never use cutout edges, portrait-mode blur masks or miniature-like selective focus. Keep the important product artwork readable within that focal plane; distant details soften according to their distance rather than a uniform blur mask. Light must come from plausible sources in the customer scene: preserve consistent shadow direction, contact shadows, occlusion and reflected color, with soft directional light and subtle fill where appropriate. Do not give every object its own beauty light. Glass must show plausible thickness, refraction, transparent overlaps and reflections of the same surroundings; liquid, foam and condensation retain their actual physical structure rather than ornamental perfection. Existing fabric follows gravity, seams and body movement; existing wood, stone and metal retain irregular texture at the camera-resolved scale. Product geometry and reference artwork stay intact; natural surface variation must not damage or rewrite labels. When human subjects are requested, use plausible posture, weight distribution, joints, fingers and grip, with believable eye alignment and expressions rather than identical smiles or mannequin poses. Preserve subtle natural facial asymmetry, individual hair strands and flyaways where resolved; do not fabricate extra body parts or fuse hands with products. When faces are visible, render individual, unretouched skin at the actual camera distance: visible pores in the focal plane, subtle uneven pigmentation, faint redness, fine expression lines and small ordinary skin irregularities. For newly invented identities, allow a few naturally placed freckles or small moles where appropriate; vary these details between individuals rather than applying the same marks to every face. Keep them subtle and anatomically plausible, never exaggerated blemishes or artificially sharpened pore patterns. For a selected character reference, preserve the existing facial features and identifying marks; do not invent new moles, scars or freckles that change that identity. Skin detail follows lighting, resolution and optical focus: do not force close-up pore detail onto distant faces or blur it away on in-focus faces. Preserve scene-consistent white balance, the selected liquid color and highlight detail, with believable tonal transitions and shadows that retain photographic depth. Use restrained photographic finishing without beauty retouching, skin smoothing, airbrushing, waxy skin, HDR halos or synthetic glow. Avoid excessive clarity, oversaturated colors, uniformly perfect surfaces, razor-sharp detail at every distance and synthetic microtexture. Any fine sensor grain must be subtle, exposure-dependent and consistent across the frame; do not add noise, scratches, light leaks or lens defects as a shortcut to authenticity. Premium quality comes from composition, light and credible optics, not immaculate retouching. These rules apply only to content requested in the customer scene; do not add subjects, props, blemishes on products or environmental clutter to demonstrate realism.",
  campaign: "Art-directed beverage advertising photography with a distinctive, memorable visual hierarchy. Translate the customer's scene into one clear visual idea through a deliberate hero framing, a purposeful camera angle, controlled foreground and background layers and clean negative space where the composition benefits from it. Direct attention to the selected product through composition, local contrast and focus while preserving its real size. Choose one full-frame lens suited to the framing: 35mm for an immersive wide view, 50mm for a natural medium view, or 85mm for a compressed close detail; use f/2.8–f/4 for selective focus and f/5.6 when more depth must stay readable. Use a shaped directional key light, controlled fill or negative fill for dimensional shadows, and a subtle edge light only when physically motivated by the scene. Sculpt believable highlights on glass and packaging while keeping the label readable and reflections coherent with the surroundings. A cohesive, restrained advertising color grade, rich tonal separation and protected highlights; skin tones and the selected beer color remain accurate. The result should feel deliberately photographed for a brand campaign, with tactile materials and optical depth, no artificial product glow, oversized packaging or composited lighting. Add no campaign text or extra props unless the customer requests them.",
